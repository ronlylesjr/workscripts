# workscripts
Some scripts I used to help make work life easier

SiteQA.py - Quick way for me to test new client sites and create reports

metatagcheck.py - Altered SiteQa.py script that checks for presence of metatag on list of sites.

verify.py - Logs into admin and opens up list of sites to compare before and after changes are made. Needs a bit of setup, create a dict with login credentials ('creds') and save as pickle.
