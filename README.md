# workscripts
Some scripts I used to help make work life easier

SiteQA.py - Quick way for me to test new client sites and create reports

metatagcheck.py - Altered SiteQa.py script that checks for presence of metatag on list of sites.

verify.py - Logs into admin and opens up list of sites to compare before and after changes are made. **6/7/17 - Using getpass instead of storing pickle for login credentials. Now more secure and no setup required.
